# TwitchArt

This project's goal is to contain anything to make generative art from a Twitch channel's viewers' stats.

For now this means:

- OBS overlay through a website URL which displays the info of the latest chatter + generative alerts
- Page displaying the info/badges of all the viewers

## Usage

For now this is for https://www.twitch.tv/superroipatate usage only.

If you'd be interested to reuse some of it, feel free to fork the project as you see fit. The only thing I request from you is to make sure not to reuse the "art" part, hence the AGPL-3.0 license.

If you need any help to engage in this sort of fork, feel free to reach out!
